Lupo delle ore </h1>
<h4 class="text-danger"> How to play:</h4>
<p>This game requires a minimum of 3 players, although groups of 7 players are ideal. One player is the "lupo" ("wolf"), and stands with his back 
to the others, who form a line at a designated distance from him. They players call out "Lupo che ore sono?" ("Wolf, what time is it?"), and the wolf answers 
with a number. The players can then take that many steps toward him, and ask again. If, instead of a number, the wolf responds with "Ho fame!" ("I'm hungry!"), 
he can turn around and try to tag asmany of the children as he can before they make it safely back to the starting line.
</p>

<h1>
Strega Comanda color</h1>
<h4 class="text-danger"> How to play:</h4>
<p>One player is chosen as the "strega" ("witch"), who calls out a color. The others must touch an object of that color,
whether it be an article of clothing or something in the surrounding environment,before the witch can catch them. The first child 
tagged becomes the next witch. If the current witch is unsuccessful, she must call out another color.
