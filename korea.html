<p>Five small stones.<p>

<h4 class="text-danger"> How to play:</h4>
<p>This traditional childhood game is similar to the American "jacks." Player 1 scatters five small stones on the ground. 
He then picks one up and tosses it in the air and quickly tries to pick up another stone in time to catch the one he just threw. 
Now he has two in his hand; he throws one of the stones up in the air, and picks up a third. This goes on until he has all the stones in his hand. 
In the second round, the player picks up two stones every time he throws one up. In the third round, he picks up three; four in the fourth,
 and the fifth time he picks them all up. For the game's last step, the player tosses all the stones in the air and tries to catch them on 
 the back of his hand. Then he tosses them up again and tries to catch them in his palm. 
The number he catches is that player's score. If he fails to catch them all, it's the next person's turn.
